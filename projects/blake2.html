               <p>Honoring one project so grand,</p>
               <p>It will stretch more than five years in the futures span </p>
               <p>towards severance of underestimating what half a years work can do.  </p>
               <p>Two great aspects of service learning and education come together as one.  </p>
               <p>We’ve only spent several weeks together and look what we’ve done. </p>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>The highlighted parts of this poem all combine to show our class and contributions. Hon 152. 78.5 hours of service. 2172 sedges planted.</p>
        <p>I wrote quite a few poems and really enjoyed it. I have always been a fan of rap music and love deconstructing the poetic aspects in the song. I’m not sure if these were my best two but these are the ones I plan to present to the class. This is probably my favorite educational project I’ve got to do all year so I hope you enjoy! </p>
