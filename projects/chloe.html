sedge pledge
i float with my friends
in a sea of sedges.
our house, the tray
our home, the dirt
we cling to the remnants of soil:
roots holding fast to the reminder of freedom.

a mission, we are told.
not to save humanity,
but perhaps one just as admirable:
saving the soil
and making the drive beautiful
(i’ll take that as a compliment).

we ready ourselves for the trans-plant.
yanked up by our heads,
they tear at my roots,
i wait my turn, dangling in the air and
looking down at my burrow.
they tamp me in,
mulch litters my head and
they scurry on to my neighbor.

the soil, it tastes metallic and bitter;
complaining it does not need saving.
i struggle to do my job.
my roots find plastic and screws,
unsure of the unfamiliar material.
its dry. hard. and yesterday,
i was stepped on.
the rain seeks out cracks in our home,
trying to join.
we try welcoming the visiting droplets,
the soil is less hospitable, though,
firmly refusing entrance.

sedge pledge: our solemn undertaking
and slowly, surely, steadily,
i stretch out and,
as i work my patient fingers through
the soil, it becomes compliant.
we promise it’s for the best,
because now, it’s our turn to hold on tightly.
once enemies,
the soil befriends the rain.
(we are told now,
the rain once misunderstood
friendship, carrying the soil away.)

winters, summers, springs, autumns,
passing by.
i watch the hydrangeas bloom, bloom, bloom,
and them arrive, leave, unpack, repack,
and the squirrels sift for food in my leaves,
and their drop-offs and commencements,
and falling snow, rain, sun beams, hail (once).
they measure us occasionally,
impressed at our growth.

they walk by and
reminisce of their hard work.
exclaiming, “thousands of sedges!”
i hold the hand of my neighbor,
our roots interlaced.
hopefully, they’ll remember my hard work too.
