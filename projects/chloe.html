            <p class="poem-text">
                <p>i float with my friends<br>
                in a sea of sedges.<br>
                our house, the tray<br>
                our home, the dirt<br>
                we cling to the remnants of soil:<br>
                roots holding fast to the reminder of freedom.</p>

                <p>a mission, we are told.<br>
                not to save humanity,<br>
                but perhaps one just as admirable:<br>
                saving the soil<br>
                and making the drive beautiful<br>
                (i’ll take that as a compliment).</p>

                <p>we ready ourselves for the trans-plant.<br>
                yanked up by our heads,<br>
                they tear at my roots,<br>
                i wait my turn, dangling in the air and<br>
                looking down at my burrow.<br>
                they tamp me in,<br>
                mulch litters my head and<br>
                they scurry on to my neighbor.</p>

                <p>the soil, it tastes metallic and bitter;<br>
                complaining it does not need saving.<br>
                i struggle to do my job.<br>
                my roots find plastic and screws,<br>
                unsure of the unfamiliar material.<br>
                its dry. hard. and yesterday,<br>
                i was stepped on.<br>
                the rain seeks out cracks in our home,<br>
                trying to join.<br>
                we try welcoming the visiting droplets,<br>
                the soil is less hospitable, though,<br>
                firmly refusing entrance.</p>

                <p>sedge pledge: our solemn undertaking<br>
                and slowly, surely, steadily,<br>
                i stretch out and,<br>
                as i work my patient fingers through<br>
                the soil, it becomes compliant.<br>
                we promise it’s for the best,<br>
                because now, it’s our turn to hold on tightly.<br>
                once enemies,<br>
                the soil befriends the rain.<br>
                (we are told now,<br>
                the rain once misunderstood<br>
                friendship, carrying the soil away.)</p>

                <p>winters, summers, springs, autumns,<br>
                passing by.<br>
                i watch the hydrangeas bloom, bloom, bloom,<br>
                and them arrive, leave, unpack, repack,<br>
                and the squirrels sift for food in my leaves,<br>
                and their drop-offs and commencements,<br>
                and falling snow, rain, sun beams, hail (once).<br>
                they measure us occasionally,<br>
                impressed at our growth.</p>

                <p>they walk by and<br>
                reminisce of their hard work.<br>
                exclaiming, “thousands of sedges!”<br>
                i hold the hand of my neighbor,<br>
                our roots interlaced.<br>
                hopefully, they’ll remember my hard work too.</p>
