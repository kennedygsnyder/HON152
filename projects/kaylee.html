        &emsp;&emsp;"For this creative project, I painted a picture of an infiltrometer. This painting is significant
        to me because it represents the large amount of time I devoted to testing infiltration and
        everything I learned during the process. In our class, I spent the most time out of everyone with
        this device and I really enjoyed getting to learn how it works. Getting it to work correctly was
        quite a challenge, as some of the soil we worked with was super dry and hard to sink the
        penetrometer into, while other soil was very wet and caused leaking during tests. Setting up the
        device through all of the mulch was very difficult, and even caused one infiltrometer to break.
        We then learned that instead of hammering on the handle of the device, a plank of wood should
        be placed over top first to avoid damage.
        
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;In addition to the challenges we faced, the use of the infiltrometer itself is extremely
        time-consuming. For each plot, the test must run four times for 5 minutes each time. This made
        for an incredibly lengthy testing process, as there were 16 regular plots and 20 control plots that
        required testing. In addition, many of the days we worked were close to freezing temperatures,
        which made the time feel even longer.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;After my work with the infiltrometer, I gained a much deeper appreciation for the science
        of ecology. While the process itself wasn’t super exciting, seeing the results were. It was really
        neat to see for myself what infiltration was like on the site, and to make inferences on why it
        might be this way. For example, sites near erosion channels tended to have very low infiltration
        rates, which could be why the channels formed instead of foot traffic like we originally thought.
        The trial and error of setting up the infiltrometer was also an important learning experience and
        forced me to come up with solutions to the problems. I felt like my work on this project was
        super valuable, and I believe that this is a unique experience I would have never even known
        existed if not for this class."
