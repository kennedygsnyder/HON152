                One by one my feet hit the ground<br>
                Entrenched in an oasis of green<br>
                A calm respite from the city around<br>
                Better to run in a nature scene<br>
                Side-to-side my tired arm swings<br>
                A way to escape the stress of life<br>

                All around me nature is rife<br>
                Truly a sight of pure allure<br>
                In a city built from metal, wood, and stone<br>
                Shining like when green was pure<br>
                When man did not sit on nature’s throne<br>
                This oasis shows the importance of green<br>
                We must do more to preserve this magic<br>
                We need everyone’s help to keep nature pristine<br>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>Last month I ran a half-marathon with my sisters, which I had to train and prepare a lot
for. A part of that meant running long distances which I really enjoyed doing at the arboretum.
Running on a treadmill did not replicate race conditions well enough, so I had to run outside to
properly train. In my opinion, it was much better to run through the arboretum than around
campus, due to the privacy, better views, good paths, and it was easier to plan out my mileage.
While running there throughout the course of the semester I truly learned to appreciate going
outside. Being able to go outside, breathe fresh air, and see a beautiful green space was always
a part of my day that I would look forward to. On days when I had to run a particularly far
mileage, I would spend up to two hours there. During that time I got to know every path like the
back of my hand and even as I would get exhausted the nature around me became my second
wind. By looking around at the trees and plants I was able to distract myself and pushed myself
to keep going.
While I spent my time in the arboretum I was able to start making connections between
the park and what we learned in class. I definitely started feeling mentally better after
maintaining a workout schedule as well as having a safe space outside of school to
decompress. It was a calm and quiet place to get away from the chaos and busyness of college
life. No matter how much my life changed I could always count on the arboretum being there. I
wasn’t the only one who greatly appreciated the park. I would often see a lot of the same people
who were enjoying the park, but also a lot of new people. There were always, a lot of families on
the weekends enjoying and learning about nature. From this, it was easy to see the societal
impacts of having green spaces near urban communities and how important it is to maintain
these spaces. Positive ecological impacts were also very visible. I saw a lot of wildlife and
variance in native plant and tree species. This is especially important in an area close to an
urban environment where a lot of the natural environment has been disrupted.
In this class, we learned all about ecological restoration, and while we had many
firsthand experiences, I never felt like I understood the purpose of restoration until spending so
much time at the arboretum. I finally was able to see the outcome of all that we were learning
about. I noticed everything helped to contribute to being able to have a place as beautiful as the
arboretum, and that more people should be educated in it like our class was. I realized how
much work and planning had to go into a place as large and purposeful as the arboretum. In our
own project, we worked with a few plots along the side of a road and planted smaller plants, this
