        <h1>Goodbye to HON 152</h1>
        <h2 class="author">By Anonymous</h2>
            <p class="poem-text">
                Great poets have often been obsessed<br>
                With trees and grass and all the rest<br>
                That blooms outside in a<br>
                Natural world of green<br><br>
                I understand the fascination<br>
                A little more with this creation<br>
                As our class project<br>
                Outside sets up the scene<br><br>
                As students out there passed me by<br>
                With fingers numb and hands bone dry<br>
                They asked me,<br>
                “What’s the point of all this muck?”<br><br>
                And frankly I could not respond<br>
                I also would’ve chosen to abscond<br>
                If only I knew<br>
                How much this class would su... rock<br><br>
                But late one night for whatever reason I<br>
                was studying up for finals season And I<br>
                came across<br>
                A poem called “A Sunset”<br><br>
                The author watched another lady<br>
                Photograph her dappled shadetree And<br>
                remarked on<br>
                How soon she would forget<br><br>
                The present beauty of the scene<br>
                When capturing it on the screen<br>
                And living away<br>
                From the joy of the current moment<br><br>
                So I thought back on our class’ aim<br>
                “huh, maybe I’m doing something the same”<br>
                So here’s my pitch<br>
                To increase future class enrollment<br><br>
                Those plants outside have benefits<br>
                Yes, through photosynthesis<br>
                But also so much more<br>
                As we all know<br><br>
                Starting with the smallest cell<br>
                The nutrients these plants expel<br>
                Will help bacteria<br>
                To thrive and grow<br><br>
                Nitrogen fixation is the process<br>
                That these microbes will help to progress<br>
                Cleaning air<br>
                Which we so badly need<br><br>
                UK’s second mascots, unofficially<br>
                Gray squirrels interact beneficially<br>
                Dining on and spreading<br>
                The grass seed<br><br>
                Not just for creatures but in the ground<br>
                Contributions can be found<br>
                Stormwater rushing through<br>
                Will just get trapped<br><br>
                Compacted soil is another aspect<br>
                That pedestrians surely will not respect<br>
                We’d put up a sign, but<br>
                They’d just not adapt<br><br>
                Studies have shown, and we’ve read a wealth<br>
                That green space improves mental health<br>
                A struggle that, as students<br>
                We’re all too familiar with<br><br>
                I know you were waiting, the big one is here<br>
                Plants help our warming atmosphere<br>
                To grab that CO2<br>
                Before ice caps are myth<br><br>
                Better sleep, productivity, job satisfaction<br>
                Planting these here is not a knee-jerk reaction<br>
                We just heard on Monday<br>
                From someone who looks o’er the site<br><br>
                That a project like ours has been long overdue<br>
                That mud and erosion have too long accrued<br>
                And, if nothing else,<br>
                At least the view now is alright
