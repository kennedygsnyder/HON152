Goodbye to HON 152
Anonymous
Great poets have often been obsessed
With trees and grass and all the rest
That blooms outside in a
Natural world of green
I understand the fascination
A little more with this creation
As our class project
Outside sets up the scene
As students out there passed me by
With fingers numb and hands bone dry
They asked me,
“What’s the point of all this muck?”
And frankly I could not respond
I also would’ve chosen to abscond
If only I knew
How much this class would su... rock
But late one night for whatever reason I
was studying up for finals season And I
came across
A poem called “A Sunset”
The author watched another lady
Photograph her dappled shadetree And
remarked on
How soon she would forget
The present beauty of the scene
When capturing it on the screen
And living away
From the joy of the current moment
So I thought back on our class’ aim
“huh, maybe I’m doing something the same”
So here’s my pitch
To increase future class enrollment
Those plants outside have benefits
Yes, through photosynthesis
But also so much more
As we all know
Starting with the smallest cell
The nutrients these plants expel
Will help bacteria
To thrive and grow
Nitrogen fixation is the process
That these microbes will help to progress
Cleaning air
Which we so badly need
UK’s second mascots, unofficially
Gray squirrels interact beneficially
Dining on and spreading
The grass seed
Not just for creatures but in the ground
Contributions can be found
Stormwater rushing through
Will just get trapped
Compacted soil is another aspect
That pedestrians surely will not respect
We’d put up a sign, but
They’d just not adapt
Studies have shown, and we’ve read a wealth
That green space improves mental health
A struggle that, as students
We’re all too familiar with
I know you were waiting, the big one is here
Plants help our warming atmosphere
To grab that CO2
Before ice caps are myth
Better sleep, productivity, job satisfaction
Planting these here is not a knee-jerk reaction
We just heard on Monday
From someone who looks o’er the site
That a project like ours has been long overdue
That mud and erosion have too long accrued
And, if nothing else,
At least the view now is alright
