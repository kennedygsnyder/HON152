               <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Down the hill and across the creek, stands a tree towering above me. Its branches stretch out trying to touch the sky. Though its roots prevent the tree flying away and joining the birds who take shelter in its branches. Its leaves are a healthy, green trading sunlight for food. And when it rains water droplets slide off the leaves onto the ground where the soil absorbs them for the pleasure of the roots of the tree, which eagerly drinks the water from the soil. The trees not alone either. It’s surrounded by others. Their ends intertwine and create a cool, permeable canopy where the foxes go to lay in the shade, and the deer and bunnies go to munch on the grass. I, too, sit there. in the cool of the shade, taking in the beautiful scenery.</p>
               <p>Alone they are not much</p>
               <p>Together they make a forest</p>
               <p>Perfect Harmony</p>
               <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Down the stairs and across the street, a tree braces itself for the coming noon. Soon the sun will hide behind the nearby building, starving the tree’s leaves so they long for the morning. Meanwhile, its roots are being overran with H2O while the nutrients around them fade. Last winter, the grass died, and, in the spring, it didn’t grow back. The foxes don’t rest under the leaves anymore either. The constant sound of cars zooming by has scared them back to their dens. The bunnies and deer don’t eat the grass there either. The birds have found new homes, and all that is left are squirrels. There will always be squirrels. And the soil, washed away by storms and eroded by wind, has hardened to rock beneath the people’s shoes.</p>
               <p>Another freeway!</p>
               <p>We want urbanization!</p>
               <p>Unhinged chaos roars!</p>
               <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Down the stairs and across the street, still stands that same, strong tree. It’s not totally alone anymore. More have been planted around it. And occasionally a deer will swing by and eat from its lower branches. The street has grown quieter, and some grass has taken root and grown back. The soil softened as well. And the building’s been renovated and lowered, giving the leaves more time to photosynthesize in the noon sky. Life is better for the tree, not as good as it was in the beginning, but better than before.</p>

               <p>It will never be perfect</p>
               <p>But still important</p>
