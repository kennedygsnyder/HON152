Old Urban Tree 

What was once an endless field now cannot contain my leaves 

A diverse world turned to homogeneity 

Designed to bite the hand that feeds it 

This new world stretches endlessly 

Or at least so I think 

I have not hope left 

But I pray my seeds get to see 

Something better than whats in store for me 

For now I wait for spring 

To see the flowers bloom pink 

And wonder whats left in store for an old urban tree. 

 

Our Project 

Honoring one project so grand, 

It will stretch more than five years in the futures span 

towards severance of underestimating what half a years work can do. 

Two great aspects of service learning and education come together as one. 

We’ve only spent several weeks together and look what we’ve done. 

 

    The highlighted parts of this poem all combine to show our class and contributions. Hon 152. 78.5 hours of service. 2172 sedges planted.  

 

I wrote quite a few poems and really enjoyed it. I have always been a fan of rap music and love deconstructing the poetic aspects in the song. I’m not sure if these were my best two but these are the ones I plan to present to the class. This is probably my favorite educational project I’ve got to do all year so I hope you enjoy!
