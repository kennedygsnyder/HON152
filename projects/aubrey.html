               <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I thought about writing a standard poem for this assignment, but having been subjected to a number of poorly-written poems myself I chose not to take that risk here. 
                    After all, if it received similar reviews to our pre-intervention project site, which 6/7 survey respondents described as
                    “lacking aesthetic value,” I might never write a poem again. So instead I wrote this, maybe a
                    part-journal, part-confessional essay.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I love re-reading books, and I’ve never been particularly bothered by spoilers, as I often find the
                    anticipation and the “how do we get there?” more interesting than the event itself. When I
                    consume art, it’s not novelty I’m after, at least not necessarily, it’s stimulation - intellectual,
                    emotional, and whatever unrivaled quality we call “artistic.”</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When I find a book or a movie like that, something that “does it for me,” I feel like I’ve submitted
                    to the invisible thumb of the artist, so skillfully wrapped around me that I didn’t even notice it was
                    there, until I’m laughing like a madman on 2 hours of sleep in a coffee shop because
                    Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is just that damn funny, or scooping up sentences by the eyeful
                    at the mere description of a Traveller’s market in 100 Years of Solitude. And why shouldn’t I
                    return to that feeling? Why shouldn’t I revisit familiar paths, where I can greet every stone, every
                    turn, and every root sticking out of the ground as an old friend?</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Maybe the literary pioneers of the world find re-reading docile, or even childish - “a choice to
                    remain among the known and the familiar,” I imagine them saying, “is not a brave one.”</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But I believe this is a misconception. At first I re-read books out of necessity, because the ones I
                    had were the ones I’d read, but the more I re-read the more I realized how much I’d either
                    missed or forgotten. And although I remembered the landmarks, the turns, stones, and roots
                    sticking out of the ground were, more often than not, just as novel as my first time through.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Once taken paths, I realized, did not become familiar so easily.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And so rather than picking up a new book every time, I’d like to think that re-reading is a
                    different kind of bravery: a bravery of admitting imperfection, of admitting that I didn’t really
                    remember most of what happened, and admitting I still have so much more to learn.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And this brings me to my own misconception, about this class. I had the privilege of growing up
                    in a holler about an hour south of Lexington, a little over 215 acres, and much of it covered by
                    old growth forest. At least five 50-foot waterfalls can be found within property lines. I couldn’t tell
                    you how many times I went out hiking there with my dad and brother, I’d guess somewhere in
                    the hundreds, but I remember how my dad would always stop in the middle of a trail to point
                    something out - usually a mushroom, or a flower. I always found these interruptions a little
                    annoying, almost pedantic. I’d stand there for a bit, pretending to listen to the name of the thing
                    he’d found, and then we’d keep moving.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My dad has always been good at giving attention to detail, and looking back I can appreciate
                    how he tried to teach this skill to me. He may have failed, but it was a valiant effort.
                    And so on to the misconception - having grown up the way I did and being taught the value of
                    the natural world since childhood, I thought I would know a lot more about this class than I
                    actually did. I think that’s called the Dunning-Krueger effect. And sure, I knew a few landmarks
                    here and there, like the wolves were returned to Yellowstone and fixed everything, and break up
                    the roots before you plant, but by and large it was an unfamiliar path. The stones, turns, and
                    roots sticking out of the ground were more than a little novel, and at times, more than a little
                    humbling. After all, how could I have known that, as Jack informed us, the Mighty Morphin’
                    Power Geese could only be defeated by a duck-mech?</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is my second-to-last semester at UK. I registered for this class because it fit my schedule, I
                    needed a Natural Sciences credit, and I thought it would be a lot like re-reading a book. I
                    thought I made a choice to remain among the known and the familiar, where I could greet every
                    stone, every turn, and every root sticking out of the ground as an old friend. But I realized again
                    that once taken paths do not become familiar so easily, and so I’d like to think of this piece as a
                    sort of confessional, as an instance of admitting imperfection, admitting that I didn’t really
                    remember most of what happened, and admitting that I still have so much more to learn.</p>
